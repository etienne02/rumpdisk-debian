This file describes major user-visible changes between snapshot releases
that are available from:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/rumpkernel/files/snapshots/

Note that most improvements due to the bumping of the NetBSD timestamp
are not described.  For a more complete list of NetBSD changes, see:
http://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/NetBSD-current/src/doc/CHANGES

	Snapshot 7.10.2014

+ update NetBSD timestamp to 20140826 1100UTC
+ remove prehistoric examples subdirectory, just use rumprun-*
  if you want a POSIX-like API to the rump kernel
+ add initial aarch64 support
+ support cooperatively scheduled fibers as an alternative to
  pthreads on POSIX platforms
+ migrate to new github mirror of NetBSD source code at
  https://github.com/rumpkernel/src-netbsd (branch buildrump-src is
  the default one used by buildrump.sh)
+ add -F option for setting flags; replaces -32 and -64 options
+ add rump_boot_etfs_register(); used for registering etfs keys
  that will be visible immediately when (if) mountroot runs during
  rump kernel bootstrap, and can therefore be used for e.g. firmware
  images for device drivers

	Snapshot 26.5.2014

+ update NetBSD timestamp to 20140526 1100UTC
+ most weak symbols have been eliminated from rump kernels, and
  it is now possible to dlopen() components even with the
  Solaris ld.so weak symbol semantics (fixed platforms include
  Solaris, musl, and glibc with LD_DYNAMIC_WEAK unset)
+ add support for shared libs with the GNU gold linker and on
  FreeBSD and OpenBSD
+ added support for aio syscalls (via NetBSD)
+ librumpdev_scsitest is no longer installed (it was a test library
  for the SCSI stack, and is not required for normal operation.  The
  SCSI protocol stack is still offered as librumpdev_scsipi)

	Snapshot 5.4.2014

+ fix a critical bug in librumpclient (caused stdin to be closed)
+ actually include the rumpkern_time changes that were supposed to
  be included in the previous snapshot
+ linux syscall compat for time-related syscalls

	Snapshot 2.4.2014

+ add Android support
+ on Linux, remote clients can be interrupted with a signal while they
  are blocking on a rump kernel syscall (previously only SIGSTOP/SIGKILL
  were possible)
+ use sysconf to get processor count on all platforms
+ functionality provided by the rumpkern_time component is now in
  librump (i.e. do not use -lrumpkern_time)

	Snapshot 17.3.2014

+ update NetBSD timestamp to 20140317 2200UTC
+ compile options affecting rump kernels are now documented in
  src/sys/rump/README.compileopts. to access, run
  "./buildrump.sh checkout" first
+ a high-performance version of "curlwp" will be automatically
  used if supported by the target
+ rump kernels were fixed to work in static binaries with
  e.g. glibc and musl
+ support for NPF firewall driver has been added
+ many sysctl nodes required by rumprun utilities now available by
  default, including kern.urandom, kern.rawpartition, etc.
+ add rump_wmd(1) (short for Where's My Dependency).  Given a
  rump kernel component, rump_wmd lists all the components that
  are needed for successful linking
+ even more Linux syscall compat fixes (via NetBSD)
+ OpenBSD support
+ armeb support

	Snapshot 3.1.2014

+ allow IPv4-only and IPv6-only rump kernels, i.e. libnet_netinet
  provides only IPv4, and libnet_netinet6 provides only IPv6
+ update NetBSD timestamp to 20140103 1400UTC
+ allow user to specify any debug/optimization compiler flags by
  setting BUILDRUMP_DBG in the env
+ Linux syscall compat improvements (mostly via NetBSD)
+ support IPv6 address configuration in the netconfig component
+ fix NetBSD 5.x host support

	Snapshot 6.12.2013
