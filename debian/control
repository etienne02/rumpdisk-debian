Description: Rump kernel library (development files)
 Rump kernels provide free, portable, componentized, kernel quality drivers
 such as file systems, POSIX system call handlers, PCI device drivers, a
 SCSI protocol stack, virtio and a TCP/IP stack. These drivers may be
 integrated into existing systems, or run as standalone unikernels on
 cloud hypervisors and embedded systems.
